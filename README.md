# Honda Civic 4th Gen (EF) - Smart Dashboard & Data Logger

An ESP32-based intelligent dashboard and data logger for a 1991 Honda Civic with a modified D16A6 turbo engine.

## 🚗 Project Overview
This project serves as a bridge between a classic Honda OBD1 ECU and modern IoT capabilities. It provides real-time engine monitoring, automatic data logging to SD-card, and wireless battery health monitoring.

### Vehicle Specifications:
Any Honda engine with chipped OBD1 ECU with eCtune or Honda Tuning Suite

### Braking System (Integrated Service Tracker):
- **Front:** 280mm Alcon two-piece discs, Ferodo DS2500 pads, NSX dual-piston calipers.
- **Rear:** 260mm discs, Ferodo DS2500 pads, Integra Type R calipers.

## 🛠 Features
- **Live Datalogging:** Direct TTL Serial communication with the P06 ECU using the Honda Tuning Suite protocol (38400 Baud).
- **WiFi Connectivity:**
  - Automatic time synchronization via NTP.
  - Periodic battery voltage reporting to MQTT.
- **Smart Power Management:** - Deep Sleep mode with multiple wakeup triggers (Ignition/Contact, Physical button, and Hourly timer).
- **Storage & Config:** - Dynamic configuration via `settings.txt` on SD-card.
  - Automatic NVS (Non-Volatile Storage) updates for persistent settings.
- **Visuals:** 1.9" 170x320 SPI Display (ST7789) for real-time gauge rendering and changing basis settings.

## 📁 Repository Structure
